# Simon - the game

The rules of the game are simple:

Once the game is started (by pressing a key from the keyboard), 1 of the 4 plates will blink and make a sound. 
The goal is to remeber which plate was that and to click it. 
Then (on level 2) the same or another plate will blink and make a sound. This time the player needs to click on both plates (from level 1 and 2) to be able to move on. 
The game continues until the player can repeat the generated sequence and ends upon mistake.

I hope you'll like it! Have fun!
